# R and RStudio for Marketers Workshop
This is the presentation that I have given aimed at familiarizing members of marketing teams at my company with using R for data analysis and visualization.  
This was intended to be a introductory course for people with little to no R experience.  

The .pdf and .pptx are exports from the original [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_xXojkCUpvBOCG530sFkSDTw8SRpMK5d2OldTVILenU/edit?usp=sharing) presentation.
This is a modified version of the presentation with company specific information removed and in a more generic format.

I've also uploaded a .R script with the various demos referenced in the presentation as well as the sample data set.
The sample data is a slightly modified version of a video games sales history found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales).

The presentation is consists of three parts. Each part had a short practice section. Answers are included in the script.
